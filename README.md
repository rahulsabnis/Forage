# Forage
Forage is an Android application that serves as a platform to educate restaurants about the importance of limiting food waste. It serves as a food purchasing platform for consumers who can get food at incredibly low prices after restaurants close down. A 2014 study by the Food Waste Reduction Alliance found that 84.3% of unused food in American restaurants ends up being disposed of, while 14.3% is recycled, and only 1.4% is donated. Furthermore, Transportation constraints was the most often cited barrier to donating and recyclingâ€”41% and 49% of respondents identified it as a barrier to donation and to recycling, respectively. To curb this, we will operate out of centralized facilities from which users can come pick up said food. We integrated the Button Android SDK to offer Uber rides directly to the pickup locations to make it easier for people to get places farther away. According to David Spriggs, CEO of Infoxchange, "Ninety-five percent of people who are homeless have mobile phones, and 80 percent of those have smartphones". Our business model will involve our charging users for the food to ensure we can sustain the non-profit, but the prices will be reasonably low such that people with financial limitations will be able to access food.
